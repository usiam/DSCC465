    "the paper \"*Ethnicity, Insurgency, and Civil War*\" by J Fearon and D Laitin explore factors that lead to civil wars.\n",
    "They try to find a link between civil conflicts and ethnicity. This paper argues that rather than recent changes in the post-Cold War world system, it is the steady growth in protracted crisis from the 1950s and 1960s onwards, that results in the current prevalence of civil wards. Additionally, issues such as poverty, political instability and weak states also contribute to the outbreak of civil wars as they favour rebel recruitment. According to this Stanford University paper, ethnicity, political grievances and the end of the Cold War have historically been cited as factors leading to civil wars. However, civil conflict can be viewed in terms of insurgency that is characterised by small, lightly armed groups engaged in guerilla warfare from rural bases. The existence of poverty, weak states, political instability and large populations leads to conditions that favour insurgency and recruitment to rebel groups.\n",
    "Fragile states are unable or unwilling to control internal conflicts due to weak local policing and corrupt counterinsurgency practices. Ethnic and religious diversity does not necessarily lead to civil conflict in a country, despite the fact that rebel groups are often mobilised along ethnic lines during warfare. They also argue that there is little evidence that the absence of democracy and respect for civil liberties and minority groups leads to the outbreak of civil war.\n"

    "At first glance of the weights, it seems that there is a large discrepancy between how much each of the attributes affect the dependent variable. But after a closer inspection, you can see that the scales of the independent variables vary to quite an extent. E.g. the **population** attribute is on a *log-scale* certain other attributes are *binary* and some are not in log-scale. This means that the weights do not entirely represent the impact of each variable. Obviously a variable on a log-scale has a very high range of possible values compared to other attributes. This means that the parametric equation we are trying to find to define our dependent variable must account for the large difference in range of the attributes. So, while the table associates a smaller weight to the log-scaled variables, it does so to ensure that certain variables do not completely overpower the rest. A better way to find out the relative impacts of the attributes would be normalize the data so that they all fall within the same range. \n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we have implemented three different cross-validation techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Train-Test: This method partitions the dataset into **two sub-datasets** - the test and the train set. The model then learns using the training set and we test the model on \"new\" data from the test set. Finally we calculate the mean squared error associated to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> K-fold: This method partitions the original dataset into **k sub-datasets**. The model then learns using the k-1 of the subsets and we test the model on \"new\" data from the other one subset. Finally we iterate this process k times and calculate the mean squared error associated to the k different models. Then we return some aggregiate form (in our case the mean) of all the mean squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Leave One Out: This method is similar to the K-fold method except here we divide the dataset into **n sub-datasets** with n being the length of the dataset/the number of entries in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "From all these methods I get that the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Train-test CV**: 0.02234982261389473\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-fold CV**: 0.02246052322536991\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leave One Out CV**: 0.022456875235560305\n",
    "\n",
    "So from my analysis, all three methods give very comparable results. However, it appears Train-Test Cross Validation ***marginally*** gives the lowest error relative to the others followed by LLOCV. This is a little surprising at first because one could naively assume that Leave One Out Cross Validation would give the lowest error. However, it might be because of certain outliers that may have caused the mean of LLOCV to be higher than K-Fold CV as the LLOCV does many scans of the entire database."
